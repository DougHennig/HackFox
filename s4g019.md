PadC(), PadL(), PadR()
----------------------

These functions pad strings with a specified character. The final letter
of each function indicates where the padding occurs: C for center, L for
left, and R for right.

| ### Usage                            |     cPaddedString = PADC( eExpr, nLe |
|                                      | ngth, cPadCharacter )                |
|                                      |     cPaddedString = PADL( eExpr, nLe |
|                                      | ngth, cPadCharacter )                |
|                                      |     cPaddedString = PADR( eExpr, nLe |
|                                      | ngth, cPadCharacter )                |

Meaning

eExpr

Character, Memo, Numeric, Float, Currency, Double, Integer, Date or
DateTime

The item to be padded.

 nLength

Numeric

The length the string should be after padding.

cPadCharacter

Character

The character to use for padding.

Omitted

Spaces (CHR(32)) are used for padding.

Many folks don't notice the third parameter here and think these
functions can only be used to pad with blanks. cPadCharacter can be any
character at all, so you can use these functions to fill a money amount
with "\*"s or add a dot leader to an item in a report.

Another thing most folks miss is that you can pass more than just
character strings to the PADx functions without first converting them.
The conversion is automatic. The number, date or datetime is converted
so that it occupies the minimum space possible, then padding is applied.

PADL() is particularly useful when dealing with character strings
composed entirely of digits. With PADL(), it's easy to keep them
right-justified so they sort properly. If numeric character strings are
left-justified, they sort wrong. (For an example, take a look at the
SYS() functions in the FoxPro Help index— they list as SYS(1), SYS(10),
SYS(11), SYS(100), ... , SYS(2), and so forth.) It's easy to make them
sort properly though—just use:

    PADL(ALLTRIM(cNumber), LEN(cNumber))       && pads with blanks

or

    PADL(ALLTRIM(cNumber), LEN(cNumber), "0")  && pads with zeroes

Either approach yields proper sorting.

PADC() is handy in reporting when you want to center an expression, but
the expression length may vary. Apply PADC(), using the size of the
allocated space as the length.

The function shown here returns the next available ID for a specified
table. It uses PADL() to ensure that the ID has the right number of
digits. It assumes you have a table with two fields, TableName and
NextId, with one record for each table in your application. It finds and
locks the record for the specified table, grabs NextId, then computes
the next NextId before unlocking the record.

There is one thing to watch out for with the PADx() functions. If
nLength is less than the current length of cString, all three functions
truncate the original string from the right. For example:

    ?PADL("Original",5)

returns

    "Origi"
